Welcome to the fascinating world of Top-P Sampling, a crucial component of modern machine learning models and text generation systems. Let's dive right in!

Top-P sampling operates by selecting from a set of tokens based on their individual probabilities, with P being the specified threshold for choosing which token to consider at any given time during the generation process. This method can significantly impact the quality and diversity of the output generated by these models.

The implementation of Top-P is straightforward: we sort the probability values in descending order and then select the tokens whose cumulative probability reaches or exceeds the P value. Let's take a look at some examples to better understand how this process works.

Suppose we have a document with several sentences, as shown below:
```
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
Nulla facilisi. Ut elit vel nisi hendrerit mollis.
```
Let's say we want to generate a new sentence using Top-P sampling with P set at 0.9. After sorting the probability values in descending order, we get:
```
The	        0.35
quick	    0.25
brown	    0.15
fox	        0.10
jumps	    0.05
over	    0.05
the	        0.45
lazy	    0.20
dog	        0.10
Lorem ipsum	 0.12
dolor	     0.08
sit amet,	 0.07
consectetur	  0.09
adipiscing	  0.03
elit.	      0.02
nulla	    0.01
facilisi.	  0.01
Ut	        0.04
elit vel nisi hendrerit mollis.	  0.06
```
By using Top-P sampling, we select the tokens with probabilities above 0.9 and generate a new sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." Notice how this output is different from that generated by the model when no P value was set. The presence of the word "Lorem" in this case is purely random because its probability is below the selected threshold, even though it is still included in the document.

This flexibility allows us to fine-tune the outputs produced by these models and ensure that they are more relevant, accurate, and engaging. However, we must also be mindful of the potential trade-offs between diversity and accuracy when using Top-P sampling, as higher P values can lead to less diverse and more predictable outputs.
```
Exercise: 
Write a Python function that takes in a document (represented as a list of sentences) and a threshold value for the P parameter. The function should generate new sentences by applying Top-P sampling with the given P value. Ensure that your implementation handles edge cases such as empty input or negative P values.
```

Solution: 
def top_p_sample(document, p):
    if not document:
        return []
    words = sorted([word for sentence in document for word in sentence.split()], reverse=True)
    cumulative_probs = [sum([w[1] for w in words[:i+1]]) for i in range(len(words))]
    generated_sentences = []
    
    for sentence in document:
        generated_words = [word for word in sentence.split() if word not in generated_sentences and cumulative_probs[words.index([w for w, p in words][-1])] > p]
        if len(generated_words) == 0:
            break
        generated_sentences.append(' '.join(generated_words))
              
    return generated_sentences
```
