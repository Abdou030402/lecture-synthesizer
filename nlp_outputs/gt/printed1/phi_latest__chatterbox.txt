Hello students! Today I'll be discussing the Fourth Annual Test of Optical Character Recognition Accuracy. This test has been conducted by ISRI over the past four years to assess the performance of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems. These systems are designed to identify machine-printed characters on a document page using bitmapped images. 
The annual test measures the accuracy of this process by comparing the text that is produced as output with the correct text. The test aims to provide an independent assessment of system performance, measure advancements in OCR technology, gain insight into its complex nature, and identify problems at the state-of-the-art.
Over the years, the scope of the test has increased significantly. In the first year [Rice 92], six OCR systems processed binary images of 132 pages containing a total of 278,000 characters. These pages were randomly selected from a U.S. Department of Energy database of scientific and technical documents. The second year's test featured eight OCR systems using a larger DOE sample consisting of 460 pages and 817,000 characters [Rice 93a, Kanai  93].
For the third annual test in 1994 [Rice  94, Nartker  94b], we re-used this DOE sample and introduced a 200-page collection of articles from popular U.S. magazines scanned at three different resolutions. Six OCR systems were tested on pages containing nearly 1.5 million characters.
In the fourth annual test, which is our largest to date, the samples contain more than 3 million characters. They include business letters, DOE documents, and magazine and newspaper articles. Each page has been scanned four times, producing binary images at three different resolutions and one gray scale image. Additionally, we have obtained fax images at two different resolutions for each business letter page.
This year, we also introduced our first non-English sample consisting of Spanish-language newspaper articles. We are pleased to report that the speed of OCR systems has also been measured in this test for the first time.
I hope you find this lecture informative and engaging as we delve into the world of Optical Character Recognition Accuracy.
