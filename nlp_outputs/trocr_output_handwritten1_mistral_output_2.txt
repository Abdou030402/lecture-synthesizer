    Welcome, everyone, to our lecture on "International Business Environment 2001", under the course code FIBA-ON. Today, we'll be discussing the major economic indicators that influence foreign market decisions, using examples to illustrate their importance.

    The international economic environment refers to the economic conditions that impact businesses, individuals, and governments across borders. It encompasses various factors such as trade policies, exchange rates, inflation rates, and many others. Understanding this environment is crucial for businesses venturing into foreign markets, as it helps in making informed decisions regarding investment, expansion, production, and pricing strategies.

    One of the most widely used indicators to measure a country's economic performance is the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. GDP represents the total value of all goods and services produced within a country over a specified period. High growth rates in GDP indicate a healthy economy, potentially leading to increased investment decisions.

    For instance, if a company considers expanding into a new market with a rapidly growing GDP, it might view this as a favorable decision, signaling potential profitability and economic stability. Conversely, low or negative growth rates could suggest the opposite, prompting caution before making such investments.

    So, remember, these major economic indicators serve as essential tools for assessing the state of the international economic environment and predicting future trends. They are vital in guiding businesses in their foreign market decisions. Let's dive deeper into some of these significant economic indicators and their influence on foreign market decisions with more examples to come.
