    Welcome everyone, today we delve into a fascinating tale from the annals of history. Let's travel back to the College of Technology, where our story unfolds with a man named Gaitson. Now, Gaitson was on edge, preparing for all sorts of trouble, as he sensed that his tormentors were lurking. Suddenly, a figure approached him—it was none other than Abraham Lincoln, who had joined the college under an alias to monitor its activities.

    Lincoln was intrigued by Gaitson's plight and decided to lend a helping hand. You see, Lincoln wasn't just a former President; he was also a lover of geography—and he noticed that the college had some copyright issues. Now, Gaitson wasn't exactly a high-ranking official; he was more of a clerk, responsible for stamping documents. Tustralina, a colleague of his, thought it would be funny to prank him by suggesting that Callon, another colleague, was actually a ghost—since Callon was often seen smoking without a visible light under his desk.

    Then, Stephago, another character in our story, emerged from the shadows. When he saw the heavy hand, he recognized it as belonging to someone who had been missing for quite some time. This person turned out to be Lloyd, who had mysteriously disappeared and reappeared in a similar development. Lincoln and Carlton, two other characters, began to investigate this strange occurrence, believing that Stephago had mistakenly declared Lloyd dead.

    As it turns out, Stephago had indeed made an error—Lloyd was very much alive! This misunderstanding led to deep-seated prejudices among the characters, with Falton believing that good people like himself were destined to suffer. He even went so far as to contemplate killing Lloyd and those he deemed undeserving.

    But here's a crucial point: Prosperity, the magic that controlled their world, began to falter when Falton made this dark vow. Books, the source of their power, started disappearing from the library, and Falton realized that his actions were causing these misfortunes. This served as a stark reminder that our choices have consequences—for better or for worse.

    So, remember: be careful what you wish for, because it might just come true. And always consider the impact of your decisions on others. Let's take a <break time="1s"/> moment to reflect on these lessons before we move forward in our study of this captivating tale.
