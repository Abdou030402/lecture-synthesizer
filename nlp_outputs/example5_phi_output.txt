Today, we'll be talking about Impressionism, an art movement that emerged in France during the 19th century. [Pause] This period saw a departure from the highly detailed and idealized portrayals of subjects promoted by institutions like the French Academy. The artists who followed this movement sought to capture the fleeting effects of light and color in everyday scenes, often painting en plein air - or outdoors - to observe natural light and its changing qualities.

Some key figures in Impressionism include Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Camille Pissarro. These artists employed loose brushwork, open composition, and visible strokes to evoke the impression of a moment rather than rendering it in precise detail. [Reflective]

While initially criticized for their unconventional techniques, Impressionist works eventually gained acceptance and revolutionized modern art. The movement laid the groundwork for post-impressionist artists such as Vincent van Gogh and Paul CÃ©zanne, who further explored structure and emotion in their work.

Now let's dive deeper into the subject by exploring some of the key paintings from this period. [Curious] Can anyone name a famous Impressionist painting?

It's important to remember that Impressionism was more than just an art movement - it also had a profound impact on the way we see and interpret the world around us. Its legacy continues in contemporary art, photography, and digital media, influencing artists of all generations. [Enthusiastic] So next time you're walking down the street or admiring a beautiful landscape, remember that even centuries later, Impressionism's message is still very much alive.
