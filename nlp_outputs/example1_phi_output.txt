Hello there! I'm Professor [Insert Professor Name] from Oxford University. Today, we're going to discuss the life and works of William Shakespeare, one of the greatest writers in the English language. [serious] As many of you know, Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, in 1564. [enthusiastic] He is famous for his plays like "Hamlet," "Macbeth," and "Othello," which are considered to be some of the greatest tragedies ever written. 
[pause] Now, let's talk about his works that fall under different genres such as comedies and historical plays. [curious] One example is "A Midsummer Night's Dream" by Shakespeare, a comedy play. It explores love, identity, and social norms with wit and irony. Another great play he wrote is the historical drama "Henry IV," which dramatizes the complexities of political power and leadership. 
[emphasize] However, let's not forget that Shakespeare’s impact extends far beyond literature. [reflective] His insights into human nature, his use of language, and his innovative plots have made his works a cornerstone of Western education and culture. For instance, many common phrases and words are derived from his texts! And his plays continue to be performed worldwide and adapted into various media, which just shows their universal appeal and timeless relevance. [enthusiastic]
