Hello, students! Today we'll discuss computers. A computer is a general-purpose device that can carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations can be changed, it can solve more than one kind of problem. 

The first use of the word 'computer' was recorded in the first computer devices that were conceived of in the nineteenth century. These early computers were very different from the ones we have today.

I hope this helps you understand the basics of computers. Let's move on to our next topic!
