A lecture by Professor Smith:
-  Hello class, today we're going to learn about computers. Computers are general purpose devices that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. This means they can solve more than one kind of problem!
-  The first use of the word computer was recorded in the first computer devices that were conceived of in the nineteenth century. These early computers used punched cards and magnetic drums to perform calculations.
-  Now, let's talk about modern computers. They are much faster and more powerful than their early counterparts. They have become a crucial part of our lives, from the phones we use to communicate with each other to the machines that help us explore space.
-  While computers can be incredibly useful, they can also be dangerous if not used properly. It's important to understand how they work and how to keep them secure.
-  As you can see, computers have come a long way since their inception in the nineteenth century. They are now an integral part of our daily lives and will continue to play a major role in the future.
-  Thank you for your attention, and I hope you found this lecture informative!


In this logic puzzle, we're going to use the information provided by the Professor's lecture to build a database of computer systems from different periods. 
The rules are:

1. We have three types of computers: Early Computers, Modern Computers, and Future Computers.
2. We know that the First Computer was used in the nineteenth century and the most recent computer is already known to be a part of our daily lives.
3. Each type of computer has been used in at least two different eras.
4. Early computers were only used for arithmetic operations, Modern Computers are faster but they can also perform logical operations, and Future Computers will have even more advanced features.
5. All the computer types exist in a binary system, i.e., either it's an early or modern type of computer, not both.
6. We know that if a computer has been used for arithmetic operations, it cannot be a future type of computer.
7. There are more computers from the nineteenth century than there are Modern Computers.
8. Future Computers have been in use since the beginning of the twentieth century. 

Question: What is the number of each type of computer and their usage era?


The most recent computer mentioned in the lecture was stated to be already a part of our daily lives, so this can be inferred that we're talking about Modern Computers. Since they are not future computers (rule 6), there must have been at least one Early Computer in the previous eras.

Since we know that Future Computers were in use since the beginning of the twentieth century and we also know that there are more computers from the nineteenth century than modern ones, we can infer that there should be a Future Computer in the current era as well.

Knowing all this, the possible combinations for types of computers from the nineteenth to the current era would be:
- Early Computers (1) + Modern Computers (1) = 2
- Early Computers (2) + Modern Computers (0) = 2
- Early Computers (3) + Modern Computers (1) = 3
But we know that there are more computers from the nineteenth century than modern ones, so the second combination doesn't make sense. 
Hence, the only valid solution is:
Early Computers used in 1 era and a Modern Computer used in another era.

Answer: There was one Early Computer (used in the nineteenth century) and one Modern Computer (used in an earlier but unknown time). Both these computers were active in their eras, indicating a significant transition from arithmetic to logical operations in computer systems.
