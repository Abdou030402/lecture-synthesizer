[S1] Ladies and Gentlemen, let's delve into the fascinating world of computing. A computer, as we know it today, is a versatile tool, a general-purpose device indeed. It's programmed to perform a multitude of arithmetic or logical operations automatically (pauses for emphasis).

This means that the sequence of operations can be altered, making the computer capable of solving more than one kind of problem (smiles). The first recorded use of the word 'computer' dates back to the 17th century. However, it was in the 19th century that the concept of computers as we understand them today began to take shape. (Pauses for effect)

I hope this gives you a brief insight into the evolution and versatility of the computer. Stay tuned as we explore more about its fascinating history and applications! (Smiles)
