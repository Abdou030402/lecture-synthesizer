According to your notes: 
examoei axiose  is important because... (Pauses)
LFCO.S.A.  and O.F.B. are related concepts that... (Emphasizes)
O.C.I.O.T.D.C02C02I.D and O.C. are both used to represent the... (Smiles)
Least desirable outcome is L2YL and most likely outcome is L.YL2, right? (Pauses)

So, my final output will be:
(S1) Examoei axiose is important because... 
(S1) LFCO.S.A. and O.F.B. are related concepts that... 
(S1) O.C.I.O.T.D.C02C02I.D and O.C. are both used to represent the... 
(S1) Least desirable outcome is L2YL and most likely outcome is L.YL2, right? (Smiles)
