"Good morning, today I want to talk about probability and how it applies to statistics. Specifically, I will explain the concept of finding the absence of a statistic when there are multiple hypotheses being tested at once. This is called the multinomial distribution. We can use confidence intervals to determine if our findings are statistically significant or just due to chance. However, we must also consider that these intervals only give us an estimate and may not always accurately reflect the true value."
