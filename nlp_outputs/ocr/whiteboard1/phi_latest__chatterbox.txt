"Hello everyone! I am your friendly university professor, and today we will be learning about the important concept of pressure in physics. You might be wondering how this is related to our weight and syringe - well, let's find out together!
First, it's essential to understand that pressure can be measured in various units like pounds per square inch (psi) or pascals (Pa). In simple terms, when we apply force over an area, the resulting pressure is what causes things to compress or expand. For example, have you ever squeezed a syringe to get medicine out? The pressure inside the syringe changes as it's compressed, and this allows us to release medication into our bodies. 
Now, let's talk about weight - when we stand on a scale, the scale measures the force exerted by our body over an area of contact with the scale's surface, which is then displayed in pounds or kilograms. This is because pressure is defined as force per unit area. We can use this information to calculate pressure using the formula Pressure = Force/Area. 
Moving on to more advanced topics like D.A. rive-continuous and plinger - these are actually terms used to describe different types of metal alloys with varying properties like strength, corrosion resistance, and conductivity. They're important in industries like aerospace, automotive, and electronics because they can withstand extreme conditions without losing their functionality. 
In conclusion, understanding the concept of pressure is crucial for many aspects of our daily lives, from administering medication to designing durable materials. I hope this lecture has helped you better understand this fascinating topic!"
