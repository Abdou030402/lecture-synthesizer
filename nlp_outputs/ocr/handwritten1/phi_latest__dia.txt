(Smiles) Welcome back! Let's dive into the lecture notes you provided. The international business environment refers to the economic conditions that impact businesses and individuals across borders. To assess these conditions, we have various factors such as trade policies, currency rates, inflation levels, and global economic trends. 

For example, let's talk about GDP (Gross Domestic Product), which represents the total value of all goods and services produced within a country over time. This indicator is commonly used to measure a nation's economic performance.

To give you an idea, imagine a company that wants to expand its business into another country. They would consider factors like exchange rates, import/export policies, and the overall GDP growth rate of that country. All these indicators help them make informed decisions about investment, expansion plans, production strategies, and pricing models. 

For instance, if we take Canada's economy as an example, its exports to other countries play a significant role in its economic growth. In 2019, Canada earned $130 billion from its export business, which accounted for 6% of its GDP. This shows how important trade is for the Canadian economy. 

As you can see, these economic indicators provide valuable insights into the international economic environment and help businesses navigate foreign markets more effectively.
