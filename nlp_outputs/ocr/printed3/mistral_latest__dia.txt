[S1] Good day, everyone. Let's delve into the fascinating world of zero-sum games today. A key characteristic of these games is that they are "determined," which means there is a unique outcome where each player is individually rational. By convention, we define the value of a zero-sum game as the security level of Player 1.

Now, here's an interesting aspect: all combinations of maximum strategies in zero-sum games are what we call Nash equilibriums. And remarkably, these equilibriums yield the same payoff for both players. This means the multiplicity of equilibrium is no longer a real problem in this context.

Moreover, I'd like to emphasize that the set of Nash equilibriums in zero-sum games forms a convex set. So, if you imagine these equilibriums as points on a graph, they would form a continuous line rather than scattered dots.

Lastly, I'd like to highlight that finding Nash equilibriums in zero-sum games can be efficiently computed. Furthermore, forward and backward policy iteration (FP), as well as other best-response dynamics, are guaranteed to converge in these games.

Interestingly, the Minimax Theorem for zero-sum games is equivalent to Linear Programming duality. This relationship plays a significant role in the analysis of randomized algorithms.

So, there you have it! The key features and advantages of studying zero-sum games in game theory. I hope this has been enlightening for you. Thank you for joining me today.
