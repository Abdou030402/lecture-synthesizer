Ladies and gentlemen, today we'll be discussing a topic that's been debated for ages - what makes people happy? It turns out that it's not just about having more money or possessions - happiness is all about achieving goals. And to do that, you need to have a set of values that guide your actions.

Values are the things that are most important to us. They can be different for each person - some people value family and relationships, while others prioritize their own personal growth and development. But no matter what our values are, they're what drive our choices and decisions in life.

Now, you might be thinking - how do I know if my actions align with my values? Well, that's where goals come in. Goals are the things we want to achieve in life. They can be big or small, short-term or long-term. But what's important is that they're specific and measurable.

So let's say your value is family, and your goal is to have a happy marriage. That means you need to make choices that prioritize spending time with your partner, being supportive and understanding, and working through any conflicts that arise. And as you work towards your goal, your values will guide you to the right decisions.

Of course, it's not always easy to stay true to our values and goals. Life is full of challenges and obstacles that can throw us off track. But that's where perseverance comes in. It takes hard work and dedication to achieve our dreams, but when we do, the sense of fulfillment is immeasurable.

So today, I want you to think about your values and goals. What's most important to you? And what are some steps you can take to make those things a reality? Remember - happiness is within reach, as long as we keep moving towards our goals and staying true to ourselves. Thank you.
