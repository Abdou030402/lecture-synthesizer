Hello students! Today we're going to talk about Walmart's success and how it relates to strategic operational innovations and sustainability. One important strategy that contributed to their success was cross-docking. This means that products are delivered directly from incoming to outgoing trucks, which minimizes the need for storage and speeds up product distribution. 

By implementing these strategies, Walmart was able to reduce costs and delivery times. They also focused on sustainability by using blockchain technology to enhance transparency in their food supply chain and implementing Project Gigation to cut emissions. This allowed them to adapt to the rise of e-commerce through automated distribution centers and last mile delivery solutions. Combined, all of these strategies helped Walmart maintain its cost leadership and global reach, securing its position as a retail powerhouse.
