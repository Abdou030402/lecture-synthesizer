[S1] Well, good morning everyone. Today we're going to explore the fascinating world of computers! (smiles) Now, let's start with a basic definition. A computer is, by its very nature, a general-purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. This means that, unlike a specialized tool, a computer can be reprogrammed to solve more than one kind of problem. (emphasizes) The beauty of computers lies in their versatility!

Now, have you ever wondered when the term "computer" first emerged? (pauses) Well, surprisingly, the first recorded use of the word "computer" dates back to the early days of computer development! In fact, the concept of these devices was conceived in the 19th century. Can you believe it? The idea of a machine that could automatically perform calculations and logic operations has been around for over a century! (smiles)

But what's truly remarkable is how far we've come since then. From simple arithmetic to complex problem-solving, computers have evolved to become an integral part of our daily lives. And yet, the fundamental principle remains the same: computers are general-purpose devices that can be programmed to carry out a wide range of tasks. (emphasizes) So let's continue to explore this fascinating topic and uncover even more about the incredible world of computers!
