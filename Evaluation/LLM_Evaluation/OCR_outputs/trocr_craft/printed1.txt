The Fourth Annual Test of OCR Accuracy
Stephen V. Rice , Frank R. Jenkins , and Thomas A. Nartker
introduction .
For four years , 18RI has conducted an annual test of optical character recognition ( OCR ) systems
known as " page readers . " These systems accept as input a bitmapped image of any document
page , and attempt to identify the machine-printed characters on the page . In the annual test , we
measure the accuracy of this process , by comparing the text that is produced as output with the
correct text . The goals of the test include :
1 . to provide a current , independent assessment of system performance ,
2 . To measure the advances in the technology from year to year ,
3 . to gain insight into the complex nature of OCR , and
4 . to identify problems at the state-of-the-art .
The scope of the test has increased greatly over the past four years . In the first test
price 921. six OCR systems processed binary images of 132 pages containing a total of 278,000
characters . These pages were randomly selected from a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE )
database of scientific and technical documents . In the second year , new measures of
performance were introduced in evaluating eight OCR systems using a larger DOE sample 1460
pages and 817,000 characters ) Rice 93. Kanai 93. Nariker 94a ) . The third annual test refused
this DOE sample and featured a 200-page sample of articles from popular U.S. magazines
scanned at three different resolutions . Six OCR systems were thus tested on pages containing
nearly 1.5million characters ( Rice 94 , Nartker 94b ) .
In this report , we present the results of the fourth annual test , our largest and most
comprehensive to date . The test samples contain more than three million characters from
business letters , DOE documents , and articles from magazines and newspapers . Each page has
been scanned four times to produce binary images at three different resolutions , plus one gray
scale image . Furthermore fax images at two different resolutions have been obtained for each
business letter page . We introduce our first non-English sample , which is a collection of
Spanish-language newspaper articles , and for the first time , we report the speed of the OCR
systems .
