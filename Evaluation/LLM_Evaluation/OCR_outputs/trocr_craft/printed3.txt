Consequences and More
Every zero-sum game is " determined " , i.e .
there is a unique " individually rational " outcome .
By convention , the value of a zero-sum game is the security level of player 1 .
All combinations of maximum strategies in zero-sum games
are Nash equilibrium which furthermore yield the same payoff .
The multiplicity of equilibrium is no longer a real problem .
The set of equilibrium is convex .
Nash equilibrium in zero-sum games can be efficiently computed .
FP and other best-response dynamics are guaranteed to converge
in zero-sum games .
The Minimax Theorem is equivalent to LP duality and
slavs an important role in the analysis of randomized algorithms
