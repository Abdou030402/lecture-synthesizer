Welcome to today's lecture on Optical Character Recognition. Today, I'd like to share with you some fascinating insights into this technology that is transforming the way we interact with text-based information. 
The Fourth Annual Test of OCR Accuracy was conducted over four years by 18RI. This test measures the accuracy of optical character recognition systems in identifying machine-printed characters on a page. The goal of this test is to provide an independent assessment of system performance, measure the advancements in technology from year to year, gain insight into the complex nature of OCR, and identify problems at the state-of-the-art.
Over the years, the scope of the test has increased, with more sophisticated measures introduced to evaluate eight OCR systems using a larger sample size of 14610 pages containing 817000 characters. 
In this report, we present the results of the fourth annual test, which is our largest and most comprehensive to date. The test samples contain over three million characters from business letters, DOE documents, and articles from magazines and newspapers. Each page has been scanned four times at three different resolutions, plus one gray scale image, and fax images at two different resolutions for each business letter page.
Furthermore, we introduced our first non-English sample, which is a collection of Spanish-language newspaper articles. We also report the speed of the OCR systems in this test. 
In conclusion, OCR technology has come a long way over the years, and it continues to evolve. Its applications are wide-ranging, from automating data entry to enabling text-to-speech software. I hope you found this lecture informative and engaging. Thank you for your attention, and have a great day!
