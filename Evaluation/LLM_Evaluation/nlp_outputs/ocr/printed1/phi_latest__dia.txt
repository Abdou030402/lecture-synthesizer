The lecture notes provide an annual test of optical character recognition (OCR) systems, which measure their accuracy in identifying machine-printed characters on a page. The goal is to gain insight into the complex nature of OCR and identify problems at the state-of-the-art. The scope of the test has increased over the years, and the test samples contain more than three million characters from various documents such as business letters, DOE articles, and Spanish-language newspaper articles. We report on the fourth annual test, which features a larger sample size and different types of content.
