<speak>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to today's lecture on Zero-Sum Games.</speech>
AI Assistant uses OCR to interpret the handwritten notes as follows:
"Consequences and More" is a chapter discussing the outcomes of zero-sum games. It states that every game where one player's gain is another player's loss is known as a zero-sum game, which determines its outcome through a unique strategy. The conventionally defined value of such games is the security level of player 1. All combinations of maximum strategies in zero-sum games are Nash equilibrium and yield the same payoff. This multiple equilibria problem is resolved, and the set of Nash equilibrium is convex. It can be efficiently computed using FPTD (First Partial Derivatives) or other best-response dynamics, which guarantees convergence to a solution. The Minimax Theorem has been shown to be equivalent to LP duality, and it plays an essential role in analyzing randomized algorithms.</speak>
