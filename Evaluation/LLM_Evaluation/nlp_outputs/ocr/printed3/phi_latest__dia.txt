(smiling) Welcome, class! Today we will be discussing a fascinating topic in mathematics - zero-sum games. As you may already know, every zero-sum game has a unique "determined" outcome that is "individually rational" for each player. The value of the game is the security level of player 1. 

It's important to note that all combinations of maximum strategies in zero-sum games are Nash equilibrium, and this yield the same payoff. However, the multiplicity of equilibrium is no longer a real problem, as the set of equilibrium is convex. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that Nash equilibrium in zero-sum games can be efficiently computed, and FP (a best-response dynamic) and other best-response dynamics are guaranteed to converge. Finally, we have the Minimax Theorem, which is equivalent to LP duality and plays an important role in the analysis of randomized algorithms. 

I hope that was helpful in understanding zero-sum games, and I'm always here if you have any further questions!
