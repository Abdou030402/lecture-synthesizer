[S1]A computer is a general-purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations can be changed, a computer can solve more than one kind of problem. The first use of the word computer was recorded in the first computer devices, which were conceived of in the nineteenth century.
[S2]As you may have noticed, computers have become an essential tool in our lives, enabling us to perform complex tasks with ease and efficiency. They are capable of carrying out operations that would take humans a significant amount of time to complete, making them invaluable for scientific research, engineering, and other fields. 
[S3]In this lecture, we will explore the fundamentals of computers and their applications in various areas of our society. We will cover topics such as hardware and software, programming languages, computer architecture, and the role of computers in modern technology. 
[S4]By the end of this lecture, you will have a solid understanding of how computers work and be able to appreciate their impact on our daily lives. So let's get started!
