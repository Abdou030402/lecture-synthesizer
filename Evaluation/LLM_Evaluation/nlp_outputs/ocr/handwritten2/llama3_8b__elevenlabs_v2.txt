Good morning, class. Today we're going to explore the fascinating world of computers! So, let's start with the basics. A computer is a general-purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. <break time="1s"/>

Now, what does this mean? Well, think of it like a recipe book. You have a list of instructions, and you can follow them in any order you want. That's exactly what a computer program is – a set of instructions that the machine can follow. And since a sequence of operations can be changed, a computer can solve more than one kind of problem! <emphasis level="moderate">This versatility has made computers an essential tool in modern life.</emphasis>

But let's take it back to the early days. The first use of the word "computer" was recorded in the 17th century. And the concept of devices that could perform calculations automatically dates back even further, to the 19th century! <prosody rate="slow">Now, these early computer-like devices were certainly not as advanced as today's machines...</prosody>

Imagine a mechanical device, like a clockwork mechanism, designed to perform specific tasks. That's basically what the first computer devices were – the ancestors of modern computers! <emphasis level="strong">The idea was to create a machine that could automate repetitive calculations and take the drudgery out of mathematical problem-solving.</emphasis>

Fast forward to today, and we have an incredible array of computing power at our fingertips. From smartphones to supercomputers, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. And it's all thanks to the pioneering work of those early computer enthusiasts! <prosody volume="soft">As we delve deeper into this fascinating topic, remember that the history of computers is a story of innovation, perseverance, and the human desire to create tools that can make our lives easier.</prosody>

So, let's keep exploring and uncover the secrets behind these incredible machines. Who knows what wonders await us in the world of computer science? <prosody pitch="+10%">The possibilities are endless!</prosody>
