Now, let's dive into one of the most fundamental concepts in statistical inference: the p-value. (smiles) So, what is a p-value? Well, it's actually quite simple. The p-value represents the probability of finding the observed t-statistic when the null hypothesis would indeed be true. In other words, if the null hypothesis were correct, what's the chance we'd get this particular result or something more extreme?

Now, let's tie this in with our confidence intervals. (pauses) A confidence interval is used to provide a range of values within which the true population parameter is likely to lie. And here's where the p-value comes in: if the null hypothesis were true, what's the probability that our observed t-statistic would fall outside this confidence interval? That's right, it's the same thing as our p-value!

So, when we're interpreting our results, if the value of βₕ₀ falls outside the confidence interval, (emphasizes) we can actually interpret this as evidence against the null hypothesis. In other words, it suggests that the alternative hypothesis is more plausible.

(pauses for emphasis)
In conclusion, the p-value and confidence interval are two powerful tools in our statistical arsenal. By combining these concepts, we can gain a deeper understanding of our data and make informed decisions based on our findings.
