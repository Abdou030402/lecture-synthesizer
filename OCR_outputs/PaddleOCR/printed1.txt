The Fourth Annual Test of OCR Accuracy.
Stephen V.Rice,Frank R.Jenkins, and Thomas A.Nartker
1Introduction
For four years, ISRI has conducted an annual test of optical character recognition (OCR) systems
known as "page readers." These systems accept as input a bitmapped image of any document
page, and attempt to identify the machine-printed characters on the page. In the annual test, we
measure the accuracy of this process by comparing the text that is produced as output with the
correct text. The goals of the test include:.
1. to provide a current, independent assessment of system performance,.
2. to measure the advances in the technology from year to year,.
3.to gain insight into the complex nature of OCR, and
4.to identify problems at the state-of-the-art.
The scope of the test has increased greatly over the past four years. In the first test
[Rice 92], six OCR systems processed binary images of 132 pages containing a total of 278,000
database of scientific and technical documents. In the second year, new measures of
performance were introduced in evaluating eight OCR systems using a larger DOE sample (460
pages and 817,000 characters) [Rice 93a, Kanai 93, Nartker 94a]. The third annual test re-used
this DOE sample and featured a 2O0-page sample of articles from popular U.S. magazines
scanned at three different resolutions. Six OCR systems were thus tested on pages containing
nearly 1.5 million characters [Rice 94, Nartker 94b].
In this report, we present the results of the fourth annual test, our largest and most
comprehensive to date. The test samples contain more than three million characters from
business letters, DOE documents, and articles from magazines and newspapers. Each page has
been scanned four times to produce binary images at three different resolutions, plus one gray
scale image. Furthermore, fax images at two different resolutions have been obtained for each
business letter page.We introduce our first non-English sample, which is a collection of
Spanish-language newspaper articles, and for the first time, we report the speed of the OCR
systems.
