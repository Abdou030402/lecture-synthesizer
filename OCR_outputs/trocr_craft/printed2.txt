Top-P Sampling
Top-P sampling determines which tokens the model
considers when generating each word by selecting from the
smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability reaches
the specified P value . The parameter ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 ,
where higher values allow for more diverse outputs while
lower values produce more focused and predictable
responses
