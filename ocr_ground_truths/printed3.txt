Consequences and More

Every zero-sum game is “determined”, i.e.
there is a unique “individually rational” outcome.
By convention, the value of a zero-sum game is the security level of player 1.

All combinations of maximin strategies in zero-sum games
are Nash equilibria which furthermore yield the same payoff.

The multiplicity of equilibria is no longer a real problem.

The set of equilibria is convex.

Nash equilibria in zero-sum games can be efficiently computed.

FP and other best-response dynamics are guaranteed to converge in zero-sum games.

The Minimax Theorem is equivalent to LP duality and
plays an important role in the analysis of randomized algorithms.
