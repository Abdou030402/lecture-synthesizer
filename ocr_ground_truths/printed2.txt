Top-P Sampling

Top-P sampling determines which tokens the model considers when generating each word by selecting from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability reaches the specified P value. The parameter ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where higher values allow for more diverse outputs while lower values produce more focused and predictable responses.
